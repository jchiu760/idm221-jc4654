                Specializing in custom cakes, we've been a birthday staple in Philadelphia-area families since 2019. Various pastries, confections, and other baked treats cycle through our catalog, and we're always looking for new items to try! Food carries meaning, so we understand that your customer experience should be personal. That's why each of our items is carefully planned, executed, and packaged with the same love we grew up with.
            </p>
            <p>
                We currently operate virtually through our website. In the future we hope to expand to a storefront location and give back to the community by partnering with local food banks and public kitchens. For now, please support our growth by placing orders 2 weeks before your need, and providing a delivery location!
